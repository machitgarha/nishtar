# Nishtar

A simple offline 2d snake game.

You should keep yourself alive, between other players. The winner will be the last remaining snake. Use arrow keys to change snake direction.

**Note:** The current version does not have any menu for controlling the game (e.g. restarting the game), nor any popups for winner determination, unfortunately. The only simple way to restart the game is to reload the browser. See "Contribution" section.

## Multiplayer Mode

It is possible to add more than one player via hacking the code a little bit, but due to the lack of a control menu in the game, it is impossible to choose the number of players in the game dynamically, without a code change.

## Build

Nothing. Simply, clone the repository, and open `index.html` file in a browser.

## Contribution

You are greatly invited to contribute. Issues and, specially Pull Requests, are welcomed.

If you want to, the following things are in priority:

-   Add an alert showing who won the game. Yes, this seems to be necessary for a game, but time sometimes laugh at you.
-   Add a control menu for game, consisting of options like starting or restarting the game.
-   Support multiplayer mode (and its control options), as described above.
